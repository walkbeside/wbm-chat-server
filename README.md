# Walk Beside - chat server

This reposirtory is for coding on Walk Beside project, [https://github.com/walkbeside/start-here](), specifically on the chat server.

### Level 2

MQTT Server

We intend to use NodeJS and [https://github.com/mcollina/mosca]() as the MQTT broker

A test ionic App will be  om api/www/*

To Run the MQTT server, just run

    npm run mqtt

So far this is only a basic server.  It doesn't do things like inject the timestamp, etc
